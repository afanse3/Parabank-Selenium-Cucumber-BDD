Learning Automate Testing using Selenium Java Cucumber BDD using parabank-parasoft website

How to run
1. First you need to install Java SDK 19 version, dont' use SDK 20 because Selenium still (as of my commit) doesn't support it so it will give an error. Then install Intellij IDE.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open this file using Intellij IDE.
4. Install depedencies in the maven pom.xml.
5. Open src/test/java/runner/RunTest.java.
6. Run with debugger using Intellij.
7. You'll see in folder target/RegressionRegistrationReport.html to see if the test is succeed or failed.
